/**
 * @name STUD'IN Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a security model where publicly listed items (like
 * housing, carpools, events, and tutoring) are readable by anyone, but can
 * only be created, modified, or deleted by their authenticated owners. Core
 * user data (profiles, favorites, messages) is strictly private and accessible
 * only to the user themselves. This provides a secure-by-default environment
 * while allowing for a rich, publicly browsable application experience.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into top-level collections representing the major
 * features of the app (e.g., /housings, /carpoolings, /events). User-specific
 * data that should be private is stored in /users/{userId}. Relationships
 * are established through denormalized owner IDs (e.g., userId, driverId,
 * tutorId) stored directly on the documents, which is essential for writing
 * efficient and secure rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disallowed: It is not possible to list all users of
 *   the application (allow list: if false; on /users).
 * - Public Listings, Private Writes: Collections like /housings are publicly
 *   queryable, but write access is strictly limited to the document owner.
 * - Private User Content: Data in /users/{userId} and /favorites/{favoriteId}
 *   is accessible only by the owning user.
 * - Secure Subcollections: Access to subcollection documents (e.g., carpool
 *   bookings) is granted to both the owner of the parent document (the driver)
 *   and the owner of the subcollection document (the passenger).
 * - Message Privacy: Messages are only readable by participants of a conversation.
 *   Listing all conversations is allowed only for participants.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure performant and secure access control, owner IDs (e.g., `userId`,
 * `driverId`, `organizerId`) are denormalized and stored directly on the
 * documents they protect. This avoids slow and costly cross-document `get()`
 * calls in rules, leading to a faster and more reliable security model.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * This ruleset uses separate collections for public and private data. For
 * example, user profiles are in a user-specific path `/users/{userId}`, while
 * public housing listings are in a separate top-level `/housings` collection.
 * This is more secure and performant than mixing public and private documents
 * in the same collection.
